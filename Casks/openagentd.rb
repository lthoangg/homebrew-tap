  # The bundle ships unsigned (no paid Apple Developer ID). On
  # first launch macOS would otherwise reject it with the
  # "OpenAgentd.app" is damaged error. We replicate the
  # exact workaround from desktop/scripts/install.sh:
  # strip the quarantine xattr, ad-hoc re-sign with the
  # bundled entitlements, done.
  #
  # The --entitlements flag is critical. Tauri's build step
  # signs the bundle with our entitlements.plist embedded — but
  # codesign --force --deep --sign - *without*
  # --entitlements strips them, leaving Hardened Runtime on
  # with no exceptions. That silently breaks WebView↔Rust IPC
  # (startDragging(), toggleMaximize(), etc.), the
  # sidecar spawn, and any feature that touches
  # allow-unsigned-executable-memory,
  # disable-library-validation, network.client/server,
  # or device.audio-input.
  #
  # We ship entitlements.plist into Contents/Resources/
  # via tauri.conf.json resources so this re-sign can pick
  # it up without bundling it separately.

  # Intentionally no zap block. brew uninstall --cask
  # removes the .app and leaves user data (agents, SQLite DB,
  # wiki, workspaces, logs) in place so a subsequent
  # brew install --cask openagentd is a true upgrade, not
  # a fresh start. Users who want a full wipe should remove
  # ~/.config/openagentd, ~/.local/share/openagentd*,
  # ~/.local/state/openagentd and ~/.cache/openagentd
  # manually — see documents/docs/configuration/paths.md.

  caveats <<~EOS
    OpenAgentd is unsigned (no paid Apple Developer ID).
    The cask ad-hoc signs the bundle on install, so Gatekeeper
    should accept it. If macOS still complains, right-click
    the app in Finder and choose "Open" once.

    Apple Silicon only. Intel Mac users: install the CLI with
    "brew install openagentd" instead.

    Uninstall keeps your data. brew uninstall --cask
    openagentd removes the app only; agents, sessions, and
    wiki under ~/.config/openagentd and ~/.local/share/openagentd*
    are preserved.
